- [Detroit Labs](hhttps://www.detroitlabs.com/careers) | Detroit, MI | We don't accept resumes, and have a questionnaire (Getting to know you or GTKY) that assesses how you think among other things. We have an interpersonal interview, and then a technical interview where we have a take-home assignment. In the interview you go through the thought process of your project, add functionality if applicable, and talk about your experience. We believe that showing us your work in a practical setting is more telling of your abilities and what you will bring to the table, than writing code on a whiteboard.
