- [Detroit Labs](hhttps://www.detroitlabs.com/careers) | Detroit, MI | Our technical interview starts with a take-home assignment. In the technical interview you go through your thought process from a familiar codebase that you built, add functionality if applicable to the interview, and talk about your experience. We believe that showing us your work in a practical setting is more telling of your abilities and what you will bring to the table, than writing code on a whiteboard.
